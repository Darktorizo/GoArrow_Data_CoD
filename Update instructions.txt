This is an open call for anyone who would like to take over maintaining the database. The only requirements really are : Time and Accuracy.

The database code is written in .xml but I have always just done the adding/editing in wordpad.


Code:

<location>
<id>9494</id> <-- Increment by one per each new item
<latitude>22.200</latitude> <-- North = -22.000 (22.0n) South = 22.000 (22.0s)
<longitude>6.200</longitude> <-- West = - 6.200 (6.2w) East = 6.200 (6.2e)
<restrictions></restrictions> <-- Portal/Entry/Level restrictions
<name>Taylarn bint Tulani</name> <-- Name of the Npc/Location ect.
<type>NPC</type> <-- Types: NPC, Landmark, Dungeon, Wilderness Portal, Portal Hub, Lifestone, Village, Outpost, Town
<imgsrc></imgsrc> <-- Not Used
<hyperlink></hyperlink> <-- Not Used
<arrival_latitude>0.000</arrival_latitude> <-- Portal Arrival Latitude
<arrival_longitude>0.000</arrival_longitude> <-- Portal Arrival Longitude
<description>Quest(s): Contract: Stone Tablet Collecting.</description> <-- Notes/Info/Related Quests ect.
<date_added>2011-5-25 12:00:00</date_added> <-- Date Added
<last_update>0000-00-00 00:00:00</last_update> <-- Date Modified (If applicable)
<monsters></monsters> <-- Not Used
<dungeon_id></dungeon_id> <-- Used for Dungeons Only (Type /loc in dungeon for ID) See : Here
<retired>N</retired> <-- Location Retired Y/N (Y will hide it from visibility in GoArrow ect)
<settlement></settlement> <-- Y or Blank
<tod_req>0</tod_req> <-- Not Used
</location>

That is the short version of the requirements for updating.


I will try to update as I can via my current links, but my hope is that someone else will update it and bring to the table their own skills and style of doing it.

Thank you all for the support and time put into verifying and reporting errors to me, I hope that will continue for the next maintainer.
